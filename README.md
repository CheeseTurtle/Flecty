# Flecty

Flecty is a project to mine [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) to create machine-readable morphosyntactic dictionaries.

The dictionaries are intended for use in computational linguistics, e.g. natural language processing, machine translation, natural language production, etc.

## Dictionaries

The morphosyntactic dictionaries generated by Flecty are available in the **out** subfolder within the folder for each language. The dictionaries are XML files which comply with the dictionaries module of the Text Encoding Initiative. More will become available as the project continues.



### Licence

The morphosyntactic dictionaries are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) licence.

## Software

I’ve released the Flecty software used to create the dictionaries, in case anyone is interested to know how I did this, or even wants to try doing it.

### Prerequisites

To run Flecty, you need an XSLT processor compatible with [XSLT 1.0 or
1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt) and [eXSLT](http://exslt.org/). Flecty works with [Saxon
6.5.5](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/saxon6.5.5/) but does _not_ work with [XSLTProc](http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/); I haven’t yet worked out why this is.

### Installation

Clone the project, or click on **Download Zip** and unzip it to a directory of your
choice.

### Overview

### Preparation

Before you can run Flecty to generate a new dictionary for a category of words in a particular language, you need to create two files:

* An API call file. This is an [XML Java Properties](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html) file. (The choice of this format is not particularly significant; it’s just a handy, established XML format for storing key / value pairs.)

  The

* A transformation file. This is an XSLT transformation which looks at several specified pages on Wiktionary in turn, takes the HTML source of each page, finds the inflectional morphology, and transforms it into machine-readable TEI output.

  Needless to say, this is the tricky bit. You’ll need a basic understanding of the inflectional morphology of this category of words in this particular language. You’ll need to examine the HTML source of several Wiktionary pages for that particular category of words in that particular language to see how the inflectional morphology is encoded. You’ll also need a good knowledge of XSLT and TEI to write the transformations. Unfortunately, this goes way beyond the scope of this file. For now I can only suggest looking at the existing transformations for help.

### Running

Step 1: query the Wiktionary API to generate a list of words in a particular category:

	java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet -o und/data/und_list_cat.xml \
	                              und/und_call_cat.xml \
	                              Miner.xsl

Step 2: scrape the Wiktionary entry for each word in turn to find the infectional morphology:

	java com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet -o und/out/und_dict_cat.xml \
	                              und/data/und_list_cat.xml \
	                              und/und_scrape_cat.xsl \

Where _und_ is the ISO language code of the language whose Wiktionary you are mining (e.g. **fr** for French) and _cat_ is an abbreviation representing the category of words whose inflectional morphology you are mining (e.g. **adj** for adjectives).
